This is a fictional scenario for a game. 
If the action is not available enclose the action in #.
The probability should always be a number based on reality.

actions available: {find, move, chop tree, mining, collect}

Current activity: Fell trees for wood
1) move to forest
2) find {tree}
3) chop {tree}
probability of find {tree} at forest : 100%

Current activity: collect {gold} 
1) move to mining site
2) mining {gold}
probability of find gold at mining site : 0.2%

Current activity: Gather food from the forest (foraging)
1) move to forest
2) collect {blackberries}
probability of find {blackberries} at forest : 80%

Any natural substance that humans use can be considered a natural resource
A resource is any physical material that is a part of our planet, earth, that humans value or require.

I need to create a pc game where characters gather materials. For example

I need to determine how much time each task will take to obtain a resource based on reality. Can you generate a prompt for asking ai about Realistic Time Estimates for a specific task ?

Resources in the Middle Ages can be classified into several categories based on their nature, utility, and significance in the socio-economic context of that time. Here are some broad categories:

Land:

Agricultural land: The primary source of sustenance and wealth.
Pasture land: Used for grazing livestock.
Forests: Provided wood for construction and fuel, as well as hunting grounds.
Labor:

Serfs/Peasants: The workforce bound to the land, providing labor in exchange for protection.
Craftsmen: Skilled workers who produced goods such as tools, clothing, and household items.
Guildsmen: Members of guilds, organized groups of craftsmen that regulated and protected their trade.
Minerals and Metals:

Iron, copper, tin, and other metals for tools and weapons.
Stone for construction.
Crops and Food Resources:

Grains (wheat, barley, oats): Staple food sources.
Livestock (cattle, sheep, pigs): Provided meat, milk, leather, and wool.
Water Resources:

Rivers and streams for transportation, irrigation, and milling.
Wells and springs for drinking water.
Trade and Commerce:

Trade routes: Controlled access to valuable goods and facilitated economic exchange.
Marketplaces: Hubs for buying and selling goods.
Human Capital:

Intellectual resources: Scholars, monks, and scribes who preserved knowledge.
Military strength: Soldiers and knights for defense and conquest.
Buildings and Infrastructure:

Castles and fortifications for defense.
Churches and monasteries for religious and cultural purposes.
Roads and bridges for transportation.
Knowledge and Education:

Manuscripts and books: Preserved knowledge in religious, scientific, and literary works.
Monastic schools: Centers of education and scholarship.
Money and Currency:

Coins: Used for trade and transactions.
Social and Political Resources:

Nobility: Landowners and rulers who held political power.
Monarchy: Centralized political authority.
These categories illustrate the diverse range of resources that were essential for survival, economic prosperity, and societal organization during the Middle Ages. Keep in mind that the significance of each resource varied across different regions and time periods within the Middle Ages.
